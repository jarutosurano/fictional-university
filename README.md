Welcome to the **Fictional University** WordPress project! This repository is part of my journey following the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/become-a-wordpress-developer-php-javascript/) on unlocking the full power of WordPress, moving beyond just a blog platform, and learning how to develop fully custom WordPress-powered websites.
